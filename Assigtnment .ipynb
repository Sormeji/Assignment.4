    "Abstraction and encapsulation are two important concepts in object-oriented programming (OOP) that help in designing modular and efficient code. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Abstraction:\n",
    "Abstraction is a process of hiding unnecessary details and exposing only the essential features of an object.\n",
    "It focuses on defining a clear interface for the functionalities and properties of an object, while hiding the implementation details. \n",
    "The main goal of abstraction is to simplify complex systems by breaking them down into smaller, manageable components.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: Let's consider a car as an object. From an abstract perspective, we are only concerned with its essential features, such as accelerating, braking, and turning. \n",
    "We don't need to know the internal working of the engine, the transmission mechanism, or the electrical system. By abstracting away these implementation details,\n",
    "we can focus on using the car's functionalities without worrying about the complexities of its internal mechanisms.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Encapsulation:\n",
    "Encapsulation is the process of bundling data and the methods that operate on that data into a single unit, called a class.\n",
    "It combines the properties (data) and behaviors (methods) into a self-contained object, which can be easily used and understood without exposing its internal details.\n",
    "Encapsulation helps in achieving data hiding, code modularity, and security.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: Let's consider a class called \"BankAccount\" which has private data members such as account number, balance, and customer name, along with public methods like deposit and withdraw.\n",
    "The private data members are encapsulated within the class, and they cannot be directly accessed or modified from outside the class. \n",
    "Instead, we use the public methods to interact with the data. This way, the internal details of the bank account are hidden, ensuring data integrity and security."
